                Hi, my name is Lou Tranchitella. I live outside Philadelphia, PA with my wife Nicole.
                We have three wonderful kids who are grown and thriving in their own ways. Growing up,
                I was always inspired by sci-fi and fantasy stories and loved playing video games, but
                career options were limited at that time. I decided to pursue science and technology and 
                earned a PhD in inorganic chemistry. After teaching for a few years, spending time helping 
                raise our kids and dabbling in website development, I needed a career change. I decided to
                go back to school and earned a degree in Game Art & Design from the Art Institue of Pittsburgh, 
                focusing on 3D art. I made the jump to entrepreneur and studio owner by co-founding Play
                Eternal in June 2010. After working on a number of mobile games as a general artist (3D, 2D, UX
                and vfx) for over 10 years, I shifted my digital art career to focus mainly on concept art 
                and illustration. In my spare time I still find inspiration in reading and watching new fantasy 
                and sci-fi books and entertainment. I am also a huge Philadelphia sports fan! Thanks for 
                coming to my site and I hope you enjoy checking out some of my work!
